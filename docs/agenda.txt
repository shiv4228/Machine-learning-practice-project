5. Model Deployment 

Agenda
1 - set up the github {Repository}
    a) new environment
    b) setup.py
    c) requirements.txt

steps to start first
1> create github repository by just giving name it only.
2> create a new folder and copy its adress to open it in 
either Anaconda Prompt and Visual Code.

just open Anaconda Prompt --> for change direcotory use {cd "folder adress"} --> Enter

3> write " code . " --> this code dot basically launch the VS instance. 
in Visual studio code , we actually going to connect with our github repository.

4> after opening the VS code, open new terminal first.
 
now first setp is to create a Environment. I'm not going to create seperate environment, but actually I'm going to use ML Floder to create environment in it.
what ever packages I'm going to install will come in this folder.

To create environment, I'm basically running a code in terminal
" conda create -p venv pyhton==3.8 -y"

venv : name for our environment
python==3.8 : we will use this python version for our entire projcet.
-y : we use it just because will installation of pacakage, it will not ask for approval again. ( By default we are giving "yes" for all the approval it will ask.

5> To  activate our environment just write " conda activate venv/ ", now, after this, whatever you will do will be add into your environment folder.
6> Now to connect with our github repository, just follow the comnmands on your repository to connect your  environment in VS Code
steps to follow:
________________________
a) git init
b) git add README.md
c) git commit -m "first commit"
d) git branch -M main
e) git remote add origin https://github.com/shiv4228/Machine-learning-practice-project.git
f) git push -u origin main 

to get status of git repository, use " git status"

After sink with our git repository, use it to check " git remote -v"

Befor going to the 7th point; you have to configure your environment with
you user name and use email id, 
to do this use following commands.
for username " git config user.name " shiv455646"
for user email id : git config user.email singhshivansh5194@gmail.com

after this to check it use
" git config user.name"
"git config user.email"

after pushing to the main command: it will ask you to config you git credientials, and to connect with git you have to allow all the requirements it will ask.

7> afterwards, create a " .gitignore" file with congfig of Pyhton language. now save it as in the option given in bottom " Create .gitignore"
8> now with this much of steps, you have to update your enviroment folder too, with this gitignore file, to do this 
use it : " git pull "

9> In Vs only, create two new folders 
a) setup.py
b) requirements.txt  : --> in this folder all your packages will be stored.
